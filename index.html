      <h1> About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineering student in a bootcamp that specializes in React/Redux. 
        I've been interested in programming for years and the rigorous pace combined with phenomenal 
        support of the mentors made a coding bootcamp the perfect choice to reinvigorate my passion. 
        I pride myself in my ability to offer creative thinking, in addition to solution driven problem 
        solving, giving me a well rounded skillset. Additionally, the focus on group projects prepared me 
        to collaborate with others in an enlightening and effective matter. I look forward to learning and 
        growing endlessly in a career of everchanging technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is made to look like an old myspace profile because I wanted to give homage to a lot
        of young girls starting out their coding journeys there. I wanted to stay true to the nostalgia and 
        make it purely in vanilla css/javascript which has been a fun change of pace from the react/redux 
        projects I've been working on. After all, a great piece of advice I've recieved was to always keep your 
        fundamentals strong, because over relying on advanced libraries can make people forget how to work without them.
